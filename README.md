# CSV Simple Search

## Trello cards

## Slack channels

## Dev Setup

- `npm install` to install dependencies
- `npm run dev` to start dev server acessible via `localhost:8080`. Hot-reloading and recompiling should automatically be enabled.
- `npm run build` to build production version (in dist)

## Contributing

- all source files are in `/src`
- CSS can be added by: `import 'filename.css'`. They will be automatically included in the index.html file with appropriate vendor prefixes added (so no need to add your own)
- @alexyaseen is happy to answer any React or ES6 questions
